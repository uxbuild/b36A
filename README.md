# Classroom Manager

Classroom Manager is an SPA that allows instructors to effectively manage their student data. Once a user has successfully registered for an account and logged in, they will be given access to a platform that allows them to see their students, add new students, update existing students, and remove students.

# Getting Started

You will be working on this project for the next few workshops. Each workshop will focus on refactoring or adding new features to a different portion of this starter code. Before you start changing the code, however, it is important that you first understand how exactly the project is currently put together, so please be sure to read through [the architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md)!

The instructions for each workshop have been split into separate files:

- [34A Instructions](docs/34A.md)
- [34B Instructions](docs/34B.md)
- [34C Instructions](docs/34C.md)
